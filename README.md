# Arduino_project1
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective temperature-based automatic control system using an Arduino microcontroller and a servo motor. The system reads real-time ambient temperature using an analog temperature sensor (e.g., LM35), processes it, and adjusts the servo motor's motion accordingly.
